# NavVis Indoor Dataset
_An extensive collection of geo-referenced images from large-scale indoor spaces_

* 60,000 high-resolution images (still images, not video frames)
* Covering more than 50,000 m<sup>2</sup> of 12 different buildings at Technical University of Munich
* Extrinsic poses for all images in a geo-referenced coordinate system
* Recorded between August 2015 and March 2016
* Large variety of indoor spaces (e.g. architectural styles and lighting conditions)

## TUM LSI Dataset
The TU Munich Large-Scale Indoor (TUM LSI) Dataset was introduced and used for evaluation in [Walch et al. (2017)](https://github.com/NavVisResearch/NavVis-Indoor-Dataset#citation).

#### Deep learning for image-based indoor localization
Introducing LSTMs for structured feature correlation, Walch et al. use TUM LSI data in order to train and evaluate deep learning approaches for image-based indoor localization. Their results are on par with, or even outperform, traditional local-feature-based methods.

#### TUM LSI Data
TUM LSI is a subset of NavVis Indoor Dataset. It comprises 1314 high-resolution images, covering 5575 m<sup>2</sup> of one entire floor of a Technical University of Munich office building.

* Within NavVis Indoor Dataset, the scan ID for TUM LSI Dataset is `2015-08-16_15.34.11`.
* Please note that Walch et al. used only cameras `cam0` through `cam4` (i.e. skipping the upwards-facing camera at each capture location), resulting in a total of 1095 images used for evaluation.

## Data Organization
* The dataset is organized by individual contiguous scans.
* Images and corresponding poses are stored in separate directory structures called `images` and `poses`.
* Each scan is identified by its unique timestamp `<scan_timestamp>`.
* The `images` directory contains a subdirectory for each scan named `<scan_timestamp>` which stores all corresponding images.
* Images are grouped in sets of six. Each set was taken at the same time and (roughly) at the same _capture location_. The six images per set are numbered `cam0` to `cam5`.
* The total number of _capture locations_ can vary per scan. They are numbered starting from `00000`.

The complete directory structure is as follows:
```
images
|-- <scan_timestamp>
|   |-- 00000-cam0.jpg // first image of first capture location
|   |-- 00000-cam1.jpg
|   |-- 00000-cam2.jpg
|   |-- 00000-cam3.jpg
|   |-- 00000-cam4.jpg
|   |-- 00000-cam5.jpg // last image of first capture location
|   |-- 00001-cam0.jpg // first image of second capture location

## Data Formats
NavVis Indoor Dataset is comprised of images and correpsonding extrinsic poses.

#### Images
- File format: jpeg
- Image size: 3448 Ã— 4592 pixels
- Image orientation: see [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)
- Image DPI: 180 pixels/inch
- Color space: sRGB

#### Poses
Poses are specified by way of a transformation tree. The root of the tree is a global geo-reference in WGS84 coordinates. The root spans a metric coordinate system in which the individual scan coordinate systems are specified. Each scan, in turn, spans its own coordinate system, in which corresponding image poses are given.

- File format: xml
- Global geo-reference (root node): WGS84
  - Longitude, latitude, height above ground, 1D rotation (yaw angle)
- Scan coordinate systems:
  - 6DoF transformation w.r.t. root node
  - 3D translation: 3x1 vector (x,y,z)
  - 3D rotation: 4x1 quaternion (w,x,y,z)
- Image poses:
  - 6DoF transformation w.r.t. scan coordinate system
  - Extrinsic parameters only
  - 3D translation: 3x1 vector (x,y,z)
  - 3D rotation: 4x1 quaternion (w,x,y,z)
